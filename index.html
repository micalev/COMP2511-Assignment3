                                Apart from school and work, I like to spend my time looking for hobbies and cultivating my interests into hobbies.

                            <p>
                                My current hobbies consists of playing video games, reading graphic novels like manga and manwhas throught the internet, and looking at interior designs through Pinterest and Instagram.

                                I've also taken a huge interest in wood working, where I had made multiple trips to Home Depot in search of wood back when wood prices were cheap, and built desktop tables, shelves, and cabinets for my family, friends and I over the summer.
